------------------------------------------------------------------------

In March 2021, I made a Portfolio/blogging site using `blogdown` with Hugo's [Toha](https://toha-guides.netlify.app/) theme. While [Toha](https://toha-guides.netlify.app/) is a great theme to use, I don't feel personally connected with it. Probably because I fast-foodized the experience by getting the site up as soon as possible (the whole process was less than 30 mins).

I was unmotivated to write. And it is *obviously* the theme's fault. My procrastination has nothing to do with my existential crisis of facing the career choices I'm making in Data Science. Switching to another theme would **for sure** solve all of my problems, *right*?

Well, it **didn't**, but it was a nice distraction. I took my time this time, and I didn't expect to feel so connected to the `rstudio::blogdown` community. All of the wonderful resources have not only make this process fun, but also motivated me to write again!

Therefore, to self-congratulate the launching of my new site, in the first post, I would like to share my ways of using all the resources I came across in a process that I think make the most sense:

1.  How to start

2.  Good live demos if reading isn't your thing

3.  Switching themes

4.  What to do when things break (*because it will)*

5.  Good stuff to read after having the site up

This post also serves the purpose to document these resources. Last Updated in November, 11th 2021.

# 1. Start with this Blog Post by Alison Hill

Probably **the** **most updated**, **easy-to-read-and-follow** material on this topic. I only wish I knew about this blog post earlier. You will most likely have your site running if you follow through.

Dr. Hill shared some other great posts early on in the blog. I think those are great resources but make more sense after you have tried to deploy your site. So save it, and we will talk about it later.

The post also uses [Hugo Academic/Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/), a well-known, well-maintained Hugo theme. Hugo's theme can be the make-or-break component to your website, and it can get quite complicated. I found [Hugo Academic/Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/) a good first theme to experiment. I recommend switching themes AFTER you have the site up. And I will talk about this later.

There can be a few hiccups with all the Git-related stuff. I found most of my answers from [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan et al, or just Internet searches.

Seriously, leave this post now and go to the Dr. Hill's [post](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/). Come back after you have your beautiful site up and running.

*Welcome back!* Wasn't it a great read?!

-   If you have your site up,

-   But if you don't like reading, let's talk about Live Demos!

# 2. Good Live Demos

There are two camps of live demos/talks/videos: with or without `blogdown`.

## Non-`blogdown` Gang:

I actually set up my second site without `blogdown`. I followed this video by Ken Jee and Data Professor.

Professor Emmanuel Teitelbaum's

I am biased since I love the

Unsurprisingly, my limited web development experience and Hugo's directory structure have made this change quite difficult.

Hugo site structures are heavily dependent on the theme structure. My dream of plug themes in and out which some changes to the `.yaml` files.

I spent a good amount of time reading on the development

Hopefully, this post can help others'

If that is not you, you will need to work through [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan et al.first, then come back here when you are ready.

Since the development version of blogdown is currently only available on GitHub, you may need to setup a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html) to install it.

(I thought I could write one technical blog three times a week... How naive.)

The Hugo + Blogdown "wombo combo" is great if you are an extensive R user.

In this post, I decided to document the steps I took and change my themes.

My previous website was with Toha theme, a great

A little about me, I am a M.S. student majoring in Statistics.

Now I should clarify, I do not have any web development knowledge.

Resources I used:

-   Emmanuel Teitelbaum
-   <https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/#we-made-it>

Pre-requisites:

-   Github account

-   Git

-   Rmarkdown (on Rstudio)

Workflow:

-   Create a Github account and a new repo (if you haven't already)

-   

I argue that is it better to watch other's workflow via github.

# 3. Theme ?

## Switching themes:

Switching themes is actually easier than I thought. I spent a lot of time researching the heavily nested Hugo directory structure, hoping that .

## Themes:

this is where things can be a bit case-to-case.
